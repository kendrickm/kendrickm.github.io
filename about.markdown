Software Development, Cycling, Cooking, Movies, and Christ!

[My bucketlist!](/bucketlist)

### Software Development
I love deconstructing complicated systems, and identifying areas of improvement. I've spent over a decade working in the DevOps/SRE/Systems Engineering. I have done [some work](https://appsaloon.be/blog/service-webhooks-in-portainer/) in GoLang, and am currently working towards [learning more.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDZujg-VgQlZUy1iCqBbe5faZLMkA3g2x) I dream of working on some of the high-traffic backends like an MMO etc. but I feel like it would probably be more stressful then I realize ;-)

### Cycling
Living in Portland, Oregon I cycle almost everywhere - rain or shine. I dream of a car free lifestyle that's embraced by entire communities. I love participating in [Pedalpalooza](https://www.shift2bikes.org/pedalpalooza-calendar/) rides, or other organized events. Last year I rode in [Reach The Beach](https://action.lung.org/site/TR?fr_id=18621&pg=entry) and this year ~I am riding the [Seattle to Portland](https://www.cascade.org/rides-and-events/kaiser-permanente-seattle-portland-presented-alaska-airlines) ride.~ Cancelled due to COVID, maybe next year.

### Cooking
One of the biggest ways I spend my free time is cooking either for myself or other people. Last year I set a goal to make a [new pie every month.](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/piesofoverlook/) This year I'm focusing more on bread baking, though not posting as much to Instagram.

### Movies
I'm a big fan of film and theatre, especially local productions. I'm fortunate to live in a city that honors it's local arthouse theaters. I follow the [Slashfilmcast](https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/slashfilmcast/) crew and community for most of my film news and discussions.

### Christ
I'm involved with Door Of Hope's [NE Church plant](https://www.doorofhopene.org/) and community in Portland. I went with a TEAM group to France to commune with several churches and missonaries. I utilize the [Bible Project](https://bibleproject.com/) resources of videos and podcasts for discussions and building communities around biblical discussions.
