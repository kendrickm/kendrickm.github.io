An idea I've been ruminating on for some time with my friend [Josh Carter](https://twitter.com/JoshingCarter) is
what a great pun 'Where Theres's A Willis There's A Way' is. And also we both love movies! We started going through the
imdb page of Bruce Willis and there is a LOT there I have never seen. A lot of bad and a lot of good and a lot of stuff about this man I never knew!(Did you know he is a singer and has released a few albums?)

Enter this podcast! Each week Josh and I discuss a new work by Bruce Willis - starting with his very first work Blind Date. We'll break down the movie in general, talk about Bruce's performance, rank it against others, spin the WHEEL OF WILLIS and who knows what else? I hope you'll check us out.
