This month was a full month! One of our big events that we did was the "Providence Bridge Pedal" in Portland. This event the city
closes down all the major bridges to cars and has bike rides planned through the morning. It's mostly large groups of people bringinging their family through parts of the city not normally safe, or available, to ride on.
My wife and I packed up our 2 year old and biked across city, and rode the family ride in a loop around the city.

One of the coolest parts, and the main reason it's worth paying the fee to join, is the major interstate bridges that are high and give a great view of the city. On bike they offer the chance to see some things you're up close only in a car. 

Whenever I go on these large group rides I'm struck by how great it is to see these large group rides. You can fit so many more people on a road when you're biking then with cars. Yes you're slower moving, but maybe we need to be slower moving as a society?
