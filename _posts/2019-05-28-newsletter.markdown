Hello folks!
I've been toying with the idea for a while now of creating a sporadic method of publishing some updates, news, or info. I'm going to try for monthly, but it might change based on how often I create content worth publishing.</p>

The goal will be a short newsletter with new projects, project updates, travel news, recommendations, and other writing. You'll be able to catch up on back letters on my blog, and I'll link more in-depth project updates that I post there. Theres a pretty wide array of areas of interest, so there's no telling what will be the from time to time, but it'll give me a good place to flex my writing muscles.
