I'm returning to a [project](/projects/gaming/kendies) I started way back in 2020, the Kendies! I have created a new [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KendikanePlays) where I'm posting the videos. Mostly still short, under 5 minute, videos that briefly review the indie games I have. I'm doing 1/week mostly all old releases at the moment. I have a lot of unplayed indie games to work through before I start looking for new releases to try out. I am particularly interested in lesser known games, or older games that aren't talked about as much. Which also coincides with all the old unplayed games in my library ;-)
