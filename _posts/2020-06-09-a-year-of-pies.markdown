Last year I set myself the goal of baking a different pie every month. I have done a fair amount of baking in my life, and pie is probably one of my favorites. I hadn't done a lot of different kinds of pie in my life however, so this would be a good chance to stretch my muscles.

Using the hashtag [#piesofoverlook](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/piesofoverlook/) I made 12 pies

* Vegetarian Shepards Pie
* Grasshopper Ice Cream pie
* Key Lime Pie
* Boston Cream Pie
* Coconut Cream Pie
* Strawberry Rhubarb Pie
* Cheesecake with blueberry syrup
* Peach Pie
* Salted Caramel Apple Pie
* Pear Pie
* Carrot Pie
* Strawberry Meringue

It was a great combination of elements for a goal. Not overly ambitious(one pie a month isn't hard) fun, and everybody loves pie! I walked away with a handful of thoughts


- Custards are hard. I never felt satisfied with any custards I made
- Perfecting a crust is crucial. Once you have a crust recipe you like, keep that on repeat.
- Custards ðŸ‘Ž
- Get a crust guard or foil to prevent burning from happening on pies with a wet filling
- For multi-pie gatherings(Thanksgiving etc) make sure to have several types of pies. Mix fruit pies with cream pies or sweet potatoe pies adds a little variety to the pie loving
