As the events of last summer's social justive movements round their one year anniversary, I look back on
what we're doing nationwide, locally, and personally to continue dismantling white supremecy. One of the small movements I've been a part of has been a bi-weekly bookclub meeting reading anti-racist materials, both
to hold us accountable in keeping this in the conversation, and encourage continued learinng and not let ourselves become complacent. We take turns writing down discussion questions based on our reading. Some times
we're able to find some resources online that we can use, other times we can't find much of anything on line. I wanted to post our resources here in case there are other people searching for help on their own anti-racist journey.
