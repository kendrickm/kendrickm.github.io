The time is here. We leave Portland Friday evening on May 12th headed to Geneva. There we will meet the team and spend a week in the area visiting with missionaries, outreach programs, and marinating one community while we pray and seek God’s wisdom. Well then move on to Paris for a week with a similar plan there.

I’m in a different place today then I was when I first set down this road. No matter how often you hear stories about your life not following any plan, we all fall into that trap. It emphasized even more the need to spend this time with a completely open heart.

“Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails.” – Proverbs 19:21
