I recently just spent 5 weeks overseas for work, most of this time living out of a hotel by myself. The result of
doing this meant I had a lot of time  catching up on a lot of netflix and podcasts. So I tried something different
and made a vlog of some of the stuff I did. I didn't have anything better then my laptop webcam so I'm not super proud of the finished project, but it's a start.
