I've mentioned it in multiple paces, but repeating myself  - I started a [new YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kmartinix) for making stuff in my workshop. I had hoped to really kickstart a big bunch of projects, learnings, and experiments. It's going alright. I am trying to keep momentum in recording and publishing at least something once a week though nothings gained a lot of traction or anything. I suppose that's to be expected I'm not doing a ton of marketing other then on a new Bluesky channel. Creating social media and trying to spread the word does not really seem appealing to me anymore, but maybe I'm ok with that ending up with fewer views. I just need to actually get out and try and accomplish something.

On top of that I'm also struggling with good video footage. Trying to use iPhones and 1 action camera I have is working ok, I can just see the audio quality being a big frustration for people who are looking for regular content. Maybe I should focus on the how-to aspects more, but if I'm doing this as a way to document how-I-learn-to then theres not a lot of easy way to accomplish that. 

Another big change that came right in the middle of all this was my company laid (almost) all of us off about 2 weeks ago. It was not totally unexpected, but also a big emotional blow to my psyche that I have't quite recovered from. On top of that, my strategy for saving to buying new tools, which would lead to much better project and content, has been thrown in the trash while our financial situation is up in the air at the moment. Even though I have some options for possible work in my future it is still a big punch on any plan I had keeping me going.

I do have some good progress to report on the Router Table and that makes me happy. And I think I have a good direction to go regardless of how this whole youtube think shakes out.
