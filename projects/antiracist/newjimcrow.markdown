__Introduction__
* Michelle Alexander states that ‘Between 1960-1990, official crime rates in Finland, Germany and the United States were close to identical. Yet the US incarceration rate quadrupled, the Finnish rate fell by 60 percent, and the German rate was stable during that same time period’ - as we dive into this new book, what do you feel about this statistic? Are you surprised? What have you learned in other content about that can help add some context to this fact?

* There is overwhelming evidence that these institutions create crime rather than prevent it - let's be honest and vulnerable with each other, what internal biases do you think will be challenged in reading this book? What are your thoughts on the prison system, and where do you think you can learn more?

* Michelle Alexander states that Americans 'recognize that mobility may be difficult, but the key to our collective self image is the assumption that mobility is always possible so failure to move up reflects on one's character' - do you subscribe to this thought? Why do you think this belief is instilled in America's core values?

* What myths and assumptions does the general public believe about the criminal justice system?

* What beliefs that you hold about the criminal justice system were/are challenged by the information in this chapter?

* Why do police departments in the various states prioritize drug arrests?

* How has this reading affecting your thinking on the “War on Drugs”?

* Both the police and prosecutors have a great deal of discretion in their roles. How has this discretion been used? Should it be regulated more, or should more of an emphasis be put on the people inhabiting the roles?

* Any other themes or new information stood out to you in this chapter as significant?


__Chapter 2__
* What myths and assumptions does the general public believe about the criminal justice system?

* What beliefs that you hold about the criminal justice system were/are challenged by the information in this chapter?

* Why do police departments in the various states prioritize drug arrests?

* How has this reading affecting your thinking on the “War on Drugs”?

* Both the police and prosecutors have a great deal of discretion in their roles. How has this discretion been used? Should it be regulated more, or should more of an emphasis be put on the people inhabiting the roles?

* Any other themes or new information stood out to you in this chapter as significant?


__Chapter 3__
* Statistically Black people make up the majority of people incarcerated. Michelle Alexander points out that all races commit crimes at a similar rate. What are some reasons for this discrepancy?

* Repeated attempts to use the 14th amendment to change judicial practices in court have failed.  What stood out to you about the court cases Michelle Alexander presented?

* Michelle Alexander presented multiple examples of way in which all-white juries can be formed. Does this impact your views regarding the fairness of the judicial system?

* Can you envision another way to spend resources then policing drug crimes?

* Any other themes or new information stood out to you in this chapter as significant?


__Chapter 4__
* What was the most surprising thing you read in this chapter?

* What are the effects of Mass Incarceration on the communities which have high incarceration rates?

* What leads to the disconnect between what people outside these communities (aka white people) feel about the community’s attitudes toward incarceration, and the shame and stigma that those communities actually feel? Why does the shame and stigma persist even in these communities that know the system is rigged against them?

* Is there any reason incarcerated people shouldn’t be allowed to vote? What other rights do people lose as a result of a felony conviction?

* Michelle Alexander ends this chapter on a hopeful note. Namely, that she thinks that the current system of Mass Incarceration will fall. Have you seen any signs of this happening?


__Chapter 5__
* Michelle Alexander explains that the widespread and mistaken belief that racial animus is necessary for the creation and maintenance of racialized systems of control is the most important reason that we, as a nation, have remained in deep denial. How does this idea fit in with how you’ve recognized racism in yourself or others?

* In what ways does racial indifference differentiate the previous caste systems (slavery, Jim Crow) from mass incarceration? How does racial indifference make them similar?

* How has racial indifference played a role in the economic collapse of inner-city Black communities?

* Michelle Alexander ends this chapter on a sobering note that those left behind in poor Black communities sense that society no longer has a use for them, that the government now aims to get rid of them, and that this reflects the reality that many of us who claim to care prefer to avoid by changing the channel. Do you agree with this sentiment? Are more people in this day and age trying to face the tough realities instead?


__Chapter 6__
* Alexander described reforms and ways to change mass incarceration. She also said it would not be a simple task. Discuss the examples she mentioned, and how you can see yourself pursue it, and the limitations to pursuing it.

* How would you describe colorblindness to someone who was well-meaning, but didn't understand its true implications?

* What are your thoughts on affirmative action being counterproductive? Or that the racial caste system depends on black exceptionalism?

* Discuss "we must see the great distinction between a reform movement and a revolutionary movement" (259) and "all of us or none" (255-259).

* Looking back through all the chapters, be ready to share something general you want to takeaway or something specific that you've learned and feel a bit more confident about when entering conversations.
