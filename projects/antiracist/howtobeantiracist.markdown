---

__Chapters 1 through 3__
* Race as an inherently racist construct - why is this, and how can better understanding it lead to difficult conversations with those who disagree with movements like blm

* Discuss difference between racist, not racist and anti racist  - which exist and which don't, why is that important

* Discrimination for equity vs. discrimination for inequality - challenging the connotation of discrimination

* Racism is a collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequality - more than a person, it's a system

* A racist is someone who supports a racist policy, leading to increased inequality - broaden the definition of racism to not what you say, but what you support

* Thoughts on dueling consciousness- assimilationist, segregationist, anti-racist

__Chapters 4 through 6__

* What are some beliefs you have about biological differences that are being challenged?

* What do you think is the difference between Ibram saying “skin color is as meaningless to our underlying humanity as the clothes we wear over that skin” and being colorblind?

* Ibram described what it looked like “to be antiracist” in many ways within these last 5 chapters. Recall one that resonated and describe how you are working towards equity.

__Chapters 7 and 8__

* What are some concrete ways that the belief that black people (and other people of color) are inherently more violent or dangerous than white people manifests in everyday life? How does it manifest in your life and beliefs? Why do you think this belief is so persistent?

* How do you think internalizing this belief affects black people?

* Why do you think cultural appropriation still happens in an environment where there is a perceived cultural hierarchy? Why do we prioritize assimilation over multiculturalism?

* How do you feel about the calls for more “personal responsibility” from the black community?

* “It makes racist sense to talk about personal irresponsibility as it applies to an entire racial group.” Are there ways you see the failings of individuals as representing entire groups of people?

* How are cultural and behavioral racism different?

__Chapters 11 through 13__
* How do notions regarding who can and cannot be racist affect conceptions of power and agency for members of different racial groups? Similarly, how does the recognition of individual power impact the reach of white supremacy in your community?

* How does racializing the negative sociological outcomes of wealth inequality end up affecting both white communities and communities of color? What are some of the ways class racism is expressed/manifested in your community?

* How do segregationist, integrationist, and anti-racist perspectives differ? How are they similar? Where do you see them at play in spaces around your community?

* What is one idea from this week’s reading that runs contrary to your own experience?

__Chapters 14 and 15th__

* Both of these chapters discuss the intersectionality of race with gender and/or sexuality. What is your history with intersectional thinking, and how do these chapters fit with your existing understanding; did you learn anything new?

* Dr Kendi says "To be truly be antiracist is to be feminist. To truly be feminist is to be antiracist." -- What's the difference between a feminist and anti-racist? Can you be one without the other?

* How are homophobia and racism intertwined? What does it mean to be a queer antiracist?

__Chapters 16 through 18__

* Dr. Kendi discusses racial policies and racist policymakers vs. institutional racism.  In line with our goal to gain more knowledge to join the conversation with a little bit more confidence, how would you describe ‘racial policies’ to your family, bosses, white colleagues, non-white colleagues, etc?

* (stole this online) Dr. Kendi compares racism to cancer.  What do you think of this comparison?

* Dr. Kendi writes, “self-critique allows change” when discussing failing and succeeding on the journey to becoming anti-racist.  Share a takeaway from this book (can either be a self-reflection or general knowledge gained) and how it's helped you grow towards becoming anti-racist or understand what being Black in America means.

* What specific parts of the book have been challenging?  What parts have been encouraging to you?
